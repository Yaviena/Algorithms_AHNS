## The report of laboratory of algorithms

Here are my documents as an exam work for "The algorithms and the computing complex" lead by dr hab. Filip Rudziński.

This report is a joint of three separate laboratories of algorithms at AHNS in Radom.

You can also download the report [here](https://github.com/Yaviena/Algorithms_report_AHNS). The very final version is always the latest.
